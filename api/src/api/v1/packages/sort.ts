/*
Sort the packages using the following criteria:

- A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.

You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:

- **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
- **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
- **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.
*/

/*
QUESTIONS FOR REVIEWER

- How do we handle dimensions and mass that surpass lets say 1 billion. Does it make sense for a package to weight 1b kg or have huge dimensions?


TODOS
- to bulletproof this we should probably allow the user of this function to:
    - specify the dimension unit they are working with and we can make that conversion to cm as needed
    - specify the unit of mass and make the conversion to kg as needed
    - don't rely on positional arguments to the sort function. Use named arguments instead. 
    - use an assestion testing library e.g chai

ASSUMPTIONS
- assumes we are always working with centimeters and kilograms
- assumed we are working with small dimensions and mass
- assumes we have constants thresholds. In a production setting, this could be configured at the customer level e.g. allowed bigger thresholds for customers on a premium tier
